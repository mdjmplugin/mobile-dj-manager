Accept event payments via the Client Zone with PayPal Standard.

== Description ==

The MDJM PayPal Standard extension allows you to collect payments for events directly from your website via the MDJM Client Zone.

Payments can be collected for an event deposit, balance, or a user specified part payment towards the event cost.

MDJM will communicate securely with the PayPal Gateway APIs to process payments and upon confirmation that a payment has
been authorised, log the transaction within MDJM and update your event accordingly. Weâ€™ll even capture the fees that PayPal
charge for processing the payment and log a separate transaction against the event to truly capture your earnings.

**Key Features**
* Full IPN integration with PayPal
* Events are fully updated with the payment details
* Transactions are fully recorded
* Configure custom actions to be taken once a payment is received
* Fully customisable payments page template
